## Lily58_L3rdy

Custom QMK firmware for the Lily58 (split) keyboard, tailored with my personal keymap and Luna animation support.

### Features
- **Luna Animations**: Character animations triggered by key events and WPM (words-per-minute).
- **OLED Display**: Shows active layer and animation status.
- **Tri-layer config**: Navigation, symbols/numbers, and RGB control layers.
- **German Umlauts**: Dedicated keycodes for ä, ö, ü, and ß.
